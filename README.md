A pure HTML website built as part of my earliest lessons in frontend development.

## 🔍 Overview

This project contains three mini-sites built entirely with HTML. At the time, I had no experience with **frontend web development** — I didn't even know what an _html_ was — but this helped me understand the fundamentals of:

- Creating multi-page websites
- Using semantic HTML tags like `<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>`
- Building and styling tables
- Structuring forms
- Writing clean, readable code from the ground up

---

## 📚 Included Projects

- [Project 1 – Mac & Cheese Recipe](./HTML5%20Projects/Project%201)

  Practiced semantic elements and list structures with a recipe format.

- [Project 2 – Table Tennis Leaderboard](./HTML5%20Projects/Project%202)

  Learned how to use HTML tables to present scores and rankings.

- [Project 3 – HTML5 Forms](./HTML5%20Projects/Project%203)

  Explored how HTML forms work and what kinds of inputs users can interact with.
